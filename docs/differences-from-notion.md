- Certain block types are not supported.
  - TBD: List which ones
- Certain fields can be omitted, which would fall back to default values.
- Metadata field is present in blocks.
- grep `// notion-diverge`


## Ideas

- Let TableBlocks have caption? In Notion, they cannot have captions.
- Add subscript/superscript annotation to rich text?
